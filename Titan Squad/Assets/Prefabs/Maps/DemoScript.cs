-Haley.
Overwatch, Titan Squad has arrived on site. Give us the situation.
-Overwatch.
We're getting quite a heavy reading of Krimbar, more than expected. It seems the Infestation wasn't as strong as we hoped.
-Santias.
All the more reason to give them a hand. These Krimbar are getting desperate and dangerous.
-Overwatch.
Indeed. Listen up squad, victory here relies on 2 objectives. Your first objective is to destroy the weapon caches located around the base.
-Pan1.
-Overwatch.
Your second objective is to take communication data. This will enable us to time our counterattack properly and take out both armies in one swoop.
-Pan2.
-Overwatch.
Some captives have been taken as well. It's not a requirement, but they may have hidden contraband on them. See if you can get them out.
-Pan3.
-Overwatch.
Get a move on team. We've only got a short window to make this work, so make your shots count.
-Haley.
Understood. You heard Overwatch, team. Let's move out.
-Santias.
Heh, not an issue. I'll carve us a path right to those weapons.
-Kennedy.
You're all talk Santias. Don't forget, you're still behind my count.
-Santias.
Keep track, Kennedy. I'll blow past that count before the battle's half over.
-Haley.
Enough. Let's go.
